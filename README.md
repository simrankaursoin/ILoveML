In this project we are using three of the learning models we learned in class (Logistic regression, SVM, Neural Networks). 
For each model we try different feature transformations and different regularization techniques. We also illustrate (through graphs)
how our feature weights, and error, changed when we used different parameters, regularizations and normalizations.
